# Android Chrome CDP quirks (driving phone Chrome from Termux)

Condensed from the 2026-08 sessions building `tools/browser_raw_cdp.py` — a
raw-CDP backend that routes Hermes's friendly `browser_*` tools to the phone's
Chrome over `browser.cdp_url` (bypassing the `agent-browser` subprocess, which
is hard-platform-blocked on android-arm64). These facts are about Chrome's
devtools behavior on Android, and apply to ANY raw-CDP client (the
`browser_cdp` tool, `cdp_helper.py`, or the backend).

## Native Android reality: inactive Chrome windows

This is the single most important thing to internalize before debugging CDP on
Android. **It is not a bug and it is not optional** — it is how Chrome + Android
behave, and it will be present on essentially every non-fresh Android device a
Hermes session runs on.

- Android aggressively **backgrounds/suspends** apps (and Chrome's secondary
  windows) to reclaim memory. Chrome, instead of killing those windows, keeps
  them in its session and surfaces them in **Manage windows → Inactive (N)**.
- A real-world device shows e.g. **1 Active window** (the foreground tab you
  care about) and **13 Inactive windows** holding **~167 tabs total** (one
  window alone had 127 tabs). The active window is fully live; the inactive
  ones have renderers that are asleep/suspended.
- **CDP enumerates ALL tabs across ALL windows.** `GET /json/list` therefore
  returns the sum — e.g. **189 entries** — of which only the active window's
  tabs are actually responsive. In a measured session: **189 `/json/list`
  entries → only 1 ALIVE**, 188 DEAD (their page sockets time out on
  `Runtime.evaluate`).

**Implication:** any code that enumerates via `/json/list` and tries to drive
the first entry will drown in dead targets. The fix is to **filter to live
targets**, not to "close tabs" (see below). Closing inactive windows is a valid
*user* remedy, but the backend must be robust regardless — because inactive
windows are a permanent fixture of Android Chrome.

## Behavior facts (verified, Chrome/150 on android-arm64)

1. **`Target.createTarget` WORKS on this device** (contrary to earlier notes).
   It successfully opened Wikipedia and GitHub tabs via the page-target path.
   Treat it as available; if it ever returns `Could not create a Tab`, fall back
   to attaching an existing live target. Do NOT assume it is blocked.

2. **Browser-level socket attach is rejected for page commands.** Connecting to
   the `/devtools/browser` WebSocket and calling `Target.attachToTarget` yields a
   `sessionId` Chrome then rejects: `Session with given id not found`. **Do NOT
   use the browser-level socket for page commands.** Use each page target's own
   socket (implicit session, no `sessionId`).

3. **Robust enumeration: `Target.getTargets` (browser socket), then connect to
   each page target's own socket.** This is the authoritative, *filterable*
   source — unlike `/json/list`.

   - **`Target.getTargets` returns `TargetInfo` with an `attached` boolean and a
     `browserContextId`.** This is the filter signal: **live, drivable tabs have
     `attached == true` and `type == "page"`**. Inactive-window tabs report
     `attached: false` (their renderer is not connected). Filter on
     `attached == true` and you get exactly the live tab(s) — **regardless of how
     many inactive windows exist.** This is THE mechanism that makes the backend
     immune to the inactive-window reality.

   - **`Target.getTargets` does NOT include `webSocketDebuggerUrl`** on Android
     Chrome (unlike `/json/list`). Derive the per-page socket from the
     `targetId`: `ws://<host>/devtools/page/<targetId>` (host parsed from
     `browser.cdp_url`, e.g. `ws://localhost:9222/devtools/browser` →
     `ws://localhost:9222/devtools/page/<id>`). The page socket is an *implicit*
     session — send CDP methods with **no `sessionId`**.

   - **`Target.getTargets` is FLAPPY under load:** a single call intermittently
     returns **0** page targets even when a tab is live. Retry the call a few
     times (small gap, e.g. 0.5s) before concluding there's no responsive tab.

   - **`/json/list` is polluted** (hundreds of dead entries). Do NOT use it for
     enumeration. It remains useful only as a *rough health gauge* (entry count
     tells you how saturated the session is).

4. **Navigation to an error/blank page can stall.** If the current URL is
   `chrome-error://` / `chrome-native://` / `about:blank`, navigate to
   `about:blank` first, then to the target, and poll
   `document.readyState + '|' + location.href` until `state == 'complete'` and
   the URL is not an error URL (up to ~6s) before reporting success.

## Wedged devtools from inactive-window saturation (the one that actually blocks you)

With MANY inactive windows (tens to hundreds of suspended tabs across windows),
the CDP server becomes **saturated**:

- **Measured failure:** high-level `browser_navigate` returned
  `raw-cdp open: server rejected WebSocket connection: HTTP 500` (reproducible,
  identical across retries). The backend's open/create step chokes when the
  server is overwhelmed by dead targets.
- **Cascade:** after repeated 500s, the **entire CDP endpoint can wedge**
  (ConnectionRefused on 9222) and even the **adb wireless-debug link drops to
  offline**. Recovery then needs a phone-side re-enable of wireless debugging.
- **But the live tab itself stays 100% reliable.** Driving the *known-live*
  (attached, responsive) tab via its page-target WebSocket returned correct
  results every time (`"Example Domain"` consistently). The dead-list does not
  corrupt the live tab — it saturates the server and breaks the *open/discover*
  path + can take down the whole endpoint.

**Two-layer mitigation:**

1. **Backend (code, mandatory): filter to live targets.**
   Enumerate via `Target.getTargets`, keep only `attached == true &&
   type == "page"`, probe each with `Runtime.evaluate("1+1") → 2`, and use the
   first responsive one. Never walk `/json/list`. This makes navigation robust
   even with 13 inactive windows / 188 dead entries. (See code patterns below.)

2. **User remedy (optional, speeds things up): close inactive windows.** In
   Chrome: **Manage windows → Inactive (N) → remove them** (or open one and
   close its tabs). This drops `/json/list` from ~189 to ~1 and removes server
   saturation. It is NOT required for the backend to work (layer 1 handles it),
   but it eliminates the 500s faster. Note: `am force-stop` + relaunch does
   **NOT** help — Android restores the entire window/tab session.

## Code patterns that make a raw-CDP backend resilient

- **Filter, don't enumerate-blind.** `Target.getTargets` → keep
  `attached == true && type == "page"`. Ignore everything else. This is the
  single highest-leverage rule for Android.
- **Bound `ws.recv`.** A wedged socket blocks `recv` forever. Use
  `ws.recv(timeout=min(remaining, 5.0))` and convert a recv-timeout into a
  `TimeoutError`. Without this the agent hangs indefinitely on a dead tab.
- **Probe before use.** For each candidate (attached) tab: open its socket,
  `Runtime.enable`, then `Runtime.evaluate("1+1")` and expect `2`. Skip any
  socket that doesn't answer within a few seconds. Pick the first *responsive*
  tab, not the first listed.
- **Cap probes** (e.g. `MAX_PROBES = 6`). With many zombies, scanning all is
  minutes of hanging. Fail loudly with an actionable message ("close inactive
  Chrome windows / re-enable wireless debugging") instead of a long hang.
- **Re-enable domains per connection.** Re-issue `Page.enable` + `Runtime.enable`
  on every (re)connection — idempotent and self-heals a socket that lost enable
  state.
- **Health gauge (optional, non-blocking):** count `GET /json/list` entries. If
  it is very high (e.g. > 50), log a hint that closing inactive Chrome windows
  will improve CDP responsiveness. This is a *signal*, not a gate — the backend
  must still work via the `attached` filter.

## DOM node identity: `nodeId` vs `backendNodeId` (silent click/fill killer)

`DOM.querySelectorAll` returns **`nodeId`s** — transient, connection-scoped ids
— NOT `backendNodeId`s. If you store the raw value as if it were a
`backendNodeId` (e.g. `bid:<n>`) and later call
`DOM.resolveNode({"backendNodeId": n})` or `DOM.getBoxModel({"backendNodeId": n})`,
Chrome returns **"No node with given id found"** and click/fill silently fail
("Element not found").

**Correct pattern (verified working on android-arm64, Chrome/150):**
- For each `nodeId` from `querySelectorAll`, first call
  `DOM.describeNode({"nodeId": nid})` and read `node.backendNodeId`. Store THAT.
- Build the snapshot document with a **non-pierce** `DOM.getDocument({"depth": -1})`.
  (A `pierce: true` document's `backendNodeId`s also failed to resolve via
  `DOM.resolveNode` here — use the plain document.)
- To resolve an element to coordinates for click:
  `DOM.resolveNode({"backendNodeId": bid})` → `objectId` →
  `Runtime.callFunctionOn({objectId, functionDeclaration: "function(){ const r = this.getBoundingClientRect(); return {x: r.left + r.width/2, y: r.top + r.height/2}; }", returnByValue: true})`.
  This is reliable; `DOM.getBoxModel` was NOT on android-arm64 for
  pierce-derived nodes.
- For fill: same `resolveNode` → `callFunctionOn` with
  `function(v){ this.focus(); this.value = v; this.dispatchEvent(new Event('input',{bubbles:true})); this.dispatchEvent(new Event('change',{bubbles:true})); }`
  and `arguments: [{"value": text}]`.

**React controlled inputs need the native setter.** `Input.insertText` /
`DOM.setAttribute` does NOT update a React controlled component's `.value`
(React's `_valueTracker` ignores the synthetic change). Verified: after a
high-level `browser_type`, the input's `.value` was empty on a React
`input[name=q]`. Fix that works:
```js
var i = document.querySelector('input[name=q]');
var setter = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(window.HTMLInputElement.prototype, 'value').set;
setter.call(i, 'text');
i.dispatchEvent(new Event('input', {bubbles: true}));
```
Then submit via `form.requestSubmit()` (or `form.submit()`). This drove a real
DDG search to its results page. The `browser_raw_cdp` fill path should detect
React inputs (presence of `_valueTracker`) and use this pattern.

Storing a tag-name-only selector (e.g. `"a"`, `"body"`) as the ref also works for
`document.querySelector()` but is ambiguous on real pages — prefer the
`backendNodeId` → resolveNode path.

## Python f-string pitfall when building CDP JS expressions

Building a CDP `Runtime.evaluate` expression that contains a JS **object literal**
(`{x: ..., y: ...}`) inside a Python **f-string** silently corrupts the generated
JS. `f"(() => {{ const el = document.querySelector({json.dumps(sel)}); ... return {x: r.left + r.width/2, y: ...}; }})()"` produces `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}'` in Chrome (the `{{`/`}}` escaping interacts badly with the inner `{x:` literal). The error surfaces only at runtime as "Element not found" / null eval — easy to misdiagnose as a socket problem.

**Fix:** build the JS with **plain string concatenation**, never an f-string,
when the body contains `{...}` object literals:
```python
expr = ("(() => { const el = document.querySelector(" + json.dumps(sel)
       + "); if (!el) return null; const r = el.getBoundingClientRect();"
       + " return {x: r.left + r.width/2, y: r.top + r.height/2}; })()")
```
This is a general gotcha for any tool that constructs CDP JS payloads in Python.

## Keep Chrome FOREGROUND, not just screen-awake

Android sleeps a backgrounded Chrome's devtools socket quickly. The user keeping
"the screen awake" is not enough if Chrome is only a side panel / background app
— switch to Chrome so it is the **foreground** app, and stay in it while the
agent drives the browser. If the user switches apps mid-session, the socket goes
stale and `Runtime.evaluate` returns null even though `/json/version` still
answers 200. Symptom: `/json/version` is 200 but every `Runtime.evaluate`
returns `null` → the tab process is backgrounded, not disconnected.

`tools/browser_raw_cdp.py` implements the above. `_run_browser_command` in
`tools/browser_tool.py` hands off to it when `browser.cdp_url` is set and no
cloud (Browserbase) session is active. The inactive-window satisfaction is the
only thing that stops a green E2E, and it is handled by the `attached`-filter +
probe-cap + bounded-recv patterns above — which must be kept even after the core
patch lands, because inactive Chrome windows exist on any real Android device.

## Verifying CDP code when the live link is DOWN

The CDP endpoint wedges easily under inactive-window saturation (HTTP 500 →
ConnectionRefused on 9222 → even the adb wireless-debug link dropping to
offline). You will frequently need to verify a code change (backend filter,
plugin health signal, forwarder logic) when **no live phone is reachable**.

Do NOT claim a change works on the strength of a stale run. Verify it in
isolation with an ad-hoc script:

- Write a throwaway verifier at an **OS-safe temp path**: on Termux `/tmp` is
  non-writable, so use `$TMPDIR/hermes-verify-<name>.py`
  (or `$HOME`). Never write to `/tmp`.
- **Stub the network** so the test needs no live endpoint. For the saturation
  gauge, `monkeypatch http.client.HTTPConnection` to return a `FakeConn` serving
  a synthetic `/json/list` body (valid array, non-list JSON, and a
  `ConnectionRefusedError` case). For page-target logic, stub `websockets.connect`.
  Cover the success path AND the degraded paths (None on error, no raise).
- Assert the **threshold/branch logic** by capturing `sys.stderr` (e.g.
  `contextlib.redirect_stderr`) and checking the advisory text appears when
  count > 50.
- **Delete the script after running** (`rm` the temp file). Leave no artifact —
  the goal is evidence, not a committed test (the repo's `verify_attach.py` /
  `verify_raw_cdp_mock.py` cover the permanent suites).
- Only after the isolated check passes, report. If you also need a live
  end-to-end, do it in a separate step once the phone's wireless debugging is
  re-enabled (new random port → re-run `main.py`).

This discipline lets CDP-side changes be proven correct even on a wedged
endpoint, instead of shipping unverified or waiting for the link to come back.
